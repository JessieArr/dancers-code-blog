Outline:

- Search Engine De-Optimization anecdote
- Session times - higher or lower?
- Susan Wojcicki example - CEO of YouTube - Measure What Matters example
- Discussion of how data needs context to be useful
- The cult of data
    - Defining it
    - Signs you might be in it
        - Form your conclusion, then look for data
        - Different burdens of proof
        - You never re-examine the data to re-evaluate your initial assumptions
        - You aren't seeking out new data and information to confirm your conclusions
        - You aren't using the product itself, and talking to users to confirm whether the data says what you think it does.
- Back to SEO De-optimization
- But maybe I'm wrong about all of this
