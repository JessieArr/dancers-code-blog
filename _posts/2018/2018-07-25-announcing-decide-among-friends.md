Hey, guys!

I wanted to invite everyone to try out a new website I’ve been working on: [http://decideamongfriends.com/](http://decideamongfriends.com/ "http://decideamongfriends.com/")

My coworkers always had a hard time figuring out a fair way to decide on a lunch location for 6+ people each day.  So I thought to myself _someone should make a tool to help with this!_

So then I did.

For opinion-based decisions between many people, I consider it to be superior to other voting websites such as [http://strawpoll.me/](http://strawpoll.me/ "http://strawpoll.me/") because it allows you to demonstrate a varying level of preference between every option by dragging the sliders between -5 and +5.

It’s been really successful among my fellow lunchgoers in the office, and I hope that other people out there find it useful as well!
